# randomInputsPhysicsExams
A database of Physics exercises for generating Physics exams made with Sweave (R + LaTeX)

This repository is still under devolopment. ⛏

(I stumbled on some issues in the pdf compilation from tex, but I've just resolved them. So, I will resume my activity in order to get this repository done hopefully in the next days/weeks)

For building your pdf exam you must install the software required firstly. You will need:
1. The R compiler, which you can download it from the official [website](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).
2. An R IDE like RStudio, which you can download it from the official [website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3. A Latex compiler like MiKTeX, recommended for Windows users, which you can download it from [here](https://miktex.org/download) or LiveTex, recommended for Linux users, which you can download it from [here](https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html).

This is up to now, but more details will be included here nextly.
