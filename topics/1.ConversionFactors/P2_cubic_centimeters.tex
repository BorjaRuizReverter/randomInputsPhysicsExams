{\bf Conversion Factors.} When you listen to someone saying 'my moto has 300 cc', he means that volume of the cylinders of his motocycle occupies a volume of 300 cubic centimenters ($cm^3$). As we use to use liters as the unit of volume, which of the following should be the conversion factors that you may use to change from $cm^3$ to liters ($l$)?

\begin{solution}
Using the adequate conversion unit factors, \\
$1cm^3=1cm^3\cdot 1\cdot 1 = 1cm^3\frac{1l}{1dm^3}(\frac{1dm}{10cm})^3$\\
Thefore, the right answer is the letter \textbf{(\REF*{resp})}.
\end{solution}
